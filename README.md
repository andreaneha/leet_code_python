This is a list of the concepts I learned while doing the problems. I basically wanted one place to reference when I forget how to do simple things. Google can be full of information I don't care about

1. Two Sums
    - Solution1: loops, making things in a list into a string in one line using union
    - Solution2: using a dictionary and the dictionary's functions

2. Reverse Integer
    - calling methods from other methods in the class
    - string reversing algorithm using a pivot point
